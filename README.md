## Description
We are experimenting with AR tools in Unity. We experimented with Vuforia.

#### Shirley - Drones

I used Vuforia to make an mobile AR app.  A drone model tracks and follows a QR code. I decided to do this because it was a good extension of the Unity work I did in Hack-a-thing-1. I wanted to see how easy/hard it was to make a basic AR character show up, and do something liek tracking another item.

##### What I learned

AR is super fun!! All my friends love it too because its rare to see things using AR. I realized a lot of tutorials were hard to follow because of version differences making the intrsutction not make sense. And since working in Unity editor is more dependant on knowing where to find things versus figuring out the logic in code, whenever they shifted something across versions it was super hard to find/ unclear if I am doing something wrong. However the results look very cool and feels super rewarding. I think it will be difficult to make a lrge scale project using VR/AR if we need to make out own assets though - defintiely need people who have taken animation/ 3D modelling on the team. Another challenge is the amount of work that goes into making movements look realistic and natural. Overall it getting something done in AR seems doable once you get the hang of it, but making details/ customizations to visuals can take a lot of time.
